# Training Results

All models trained via the Lean → MLIR → IREE pipeline using
`LeanMlir.Train.train` (the unified training loop). Adam, cosine LR
with linear warmup, label smoothing 0.1, weight decay 1e-4. Eval uses
running BN statistics (EMA momentum 0.1) — not batch statistics.

Hardware: AMD Radeon 7900 XTX (gfx1100) via ROCm 7.2 / IREE.

### MobileNetV3-Large

Exact h-swish (`x * ReLU6(x+3) / 6`) and h-sigmoid (`ReLU6(x+3) / 6`) with
piecewise gradients. SE block uses ReLU on reduce + h-sigmoid on gate (V3
variant), not swish + sigmoid (EfficientNet variant).

kernel sizes (3×3 and 5×5).

### ViT-Tiny

Vision Transformer: 16×16 patch embedding → 12 transformer blocks
(192-dim, 3 heads, 768-dim MLP) → CLS token → dense. Exact tanh-form
GELU. 5-epoch warmup. Imagenette is too small for ViT to really shine
(transformers want 100K+ images), but it learns.

| Epoch | Val acc |
|---|---|
| 10 | 54.33% |
| 20 | 57.84% |
| 30 | 64.40% |
| 40 | 67.67% |
| 50 | 69.24% |
| 60 | 71.18% |
| 70 | 71.75% |
| 80 | **71.70%** |

### MobileNetV4-Medium

15 Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) blocks expressing all four
block types (ExtraDW, IB / standard MBConv, ConvNeXt, FFN) from a
single parameterized primitive. The "stop adding new block types"
philosophy in action.

| Epoch | Val acc |
|---|---|
| 10 | 75.00% |
| 20 | 79.18% |
| 30 | 82.22% |
| 40 | 82.48% |

| 70 | 84.84% |
| 80 | **84.58%** |

### EfficientNetV2-S

Three Fused-MBConv stages early (where depthwise is slow on hardware),
then three standard MBConv-with-SE stages. 38M params, 110 BN layers,
~9 min/epoch.

| Epoch | Val acc |
|---|---|
| 10 | 75.79% |
| 20 | 82.89% |
| 30 | 85.81% |
| 40 | 86.53% |
| 50 | 87.35% |
| 60 | 87.99% |
| 70 | 88.32% |
| 80 | **88.50%** |

## Training recipe ablation (ResNet-34)

| Config | Final val | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SGD+momentum, batch 16, batch-stats eval | 24.36% | initial baseline |
| SGD + WD 5e-4 + hflip + label smooth + crop | 26.53% | partial regularization |
| Adam, batch 32, cosine LR (batch-stats eval) | 52.54% | optimizer + batch fix |
| Adam, batch 32, cosine LR + **running BN eval** | **90.29%** | full pipeline |

The single biggest jump (+38 points) came from switching eval from
mini-batch BN statistics to running BN stats. The model was learning
fine the whole time — the eval was broken because batch statistics
from 32 images are too noisy to normalize correctly.

## Pipeline

```
Lean 4 NetSpec (~15 lines)
  ↓  MlirCodegen.generateTrainStep (forward + loss + VJPs + Adam)
StableHLO MLIR (~500 KB - 760 KB)
  ↓  iree-compile (~10 min for ROCm gfx1100)
VMFB flatbuffer (1.8 - 2.4 MB)
  ↓  IREE runtime via libiree_ffi.so
GPU execution (HIP / ROCm)
```

The same Lean → MLIR pipeline handles all 5 architectures. Adding a new
architecture requires extending `MlirCodegen.lean` with:
- Forward emission for the new layer types
- VJP / backward emission
- FwdRec recording for backward intermediates

The training executable, FFI, and IREE runtime are unchanged across
architectures. Only the codegen grows.
