# tinygpt_demo.md — Tiny GPT demo on Shakespeare (char-level)

Goal: a worked language-model example for the bestiary that closes
the "this framework only does vision" gap. Pairs with the five
existing vision-side demos (`unet`, `ddpm`, `bifpn`, `yolo`,
`nerf`); this is the **NLP / sequence-modeling** entry.

## Status (2026-05-08)

**Phase 1 ✓ + Phase 2 ✓ + Phase 3 ✓ shipped in 1 session.** A
212K-param char-level transformer (V=65, T=64, D=64, 2 heads, 4
blocks, causal mask) trains end-to-end on tinyshakespeare on rocm
gfx1100; autoregressive sampling produces text with real Shakespeare
character names (ROMEO, KING RICHARD III, KING HENRY VI, ISABELLA,
POMPEY, PRINCE, SICINIUS, SOMMERSET), plot-vocabulary fragments
(Claudio from *Measure for Measure*), coherent multi-line dialog,
and proper cadence/punctuation. Plan below estimated 3-4 weeks; the
actual path landed in ~5 hours of human-active code work plus
2 minutes (Phase 2 smoke) + 11 minutes (Phase 3 full) of training.

What was simplified vs. the original plan:

- **One-hot token embedding instead of gather.** Plan called for
  either a real gather primitive or a one-hot workaround "for the
  demo, ~1 day." We took the workaround: a C helper produces flat
  `[B, V*T]` one-hot from int32 token IDs, the model reshapes to
  `[B, T, V]` and applies a 3D dot with a learnable `[V, D]` matrix.
  Wasteful at large vocab (V=65 makes it cheap); upgrading to a
  proper gather is deferred until BPE-tokenized models become a goal.
- **No final positional embedding sweep / dropout.** Position is a
  learnable `[T, D]` added inside `tokenPositionEmbed`; no dropout in
  the transformer blocks (mixup-equivalent regularizer not yet in the
  codegen). Sample quality is fine without either.
- **Loss plumbing rides `useSeg`.** The plan implied a fresh
  per-token CE codegen path. Instead the lmHead's forward emits its
  output as `[B, V, T, 1]` (NCHW with NC=V, H=T, W=1) and the
  existing per-pixel softmax-CE machinery for segmentation handles
  per-token CE natively. Zero new loss code.
- **Char-level only; no BPE.** Vocab=65 raw bytes. Defers TinyStories
  / larger corpora.
- **No perplexity eval.** Loss-on-train tracked only. Visual sample
  inspection is the quality bar.

What's actually built and working:

| Piece | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Char-level tokenizer + binary packer | `preprocess_shakespeare.py` | 65-byte vocab, 1M train + 111K val tokens |
| Token-stream loader | `ffi/f32_helpers.c::lean_f32_load_token_stream` | Returns (ByteArray, n_tokens) |
| Random-chunk batch sampler | `lean_f32_sample_chunks` | Returns input + shifted targets, packed |
| One-hot encoder | `lean_f32_token_one_hot` | int32 IDs → f32 [B, T*V] |
| Causal attention mask | `MlirCodegen.lean::emitMHSAForward` | iota+select+broadcast → -inf above diagonal |
| `tokenPositionEmbed` Layer kind | `LeanMlir/Types.lean` + codegen arms | Forward + backward + Adam updates |
| `lmHead` Layer kind | `LeanMlir/Types.lean` + codegen arms | [B, T, D] → [B, V, T, 1] for useSeg |
| Per-token CE loss | reuses `useSeg` path | Drops in by output-shape match |
| TinyGPT trainer/sampler | `MainTinyGptShakespeare.lean` | train + sample subcommands |
| Bigram baseline | `MainBigramShakespeare.lean` | Validates data pipeline; ships its own sample |

### Run-by-run results

| Run | Steps | Wall time | End loss (nats/char) | Bits/char | Sample quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bigram baseline | 30 epochs × 200 | ~30 s | 2.46 | 3.55 | Speaker tags, English-ish word fragments |
| TinyGPT smoke | 50 | ~10 s | NaN (debug) | — | (ABI shakedown — found a `transformerEncoder` pattern bug that silently wildcarded several arms) |
| TinyGPT 100 | 100 | ~12 s | 2.65 | 3.83 | Worse than bigram still (200K params, untrained) |
| TinyGPT 2K | 2,000 | 2m14s | 1.63 | 2.36 | First **recognizable Shakespeare**: speaker tags, real words, dialog format |
| TinyGPT 10K | 10,000 | ~11 min | 1.45 | 2.10 | Real Shakespeare names + Claudio reference + multi-line dialog (`blueprint/src/figures/tinygpt/tinygpt_sample.txt`) |

Random uniform over 65 chars: 4.17 nats/char (6.02 bits). Paper-quality
char-level GPT (much bigger models) lands ~1.0 bits/char. We're about
halfway between the bigram baseline (3.55 bits) and paper quality.

And spuress and the seals destaint in heirs;

```

### What's left to push quality further

Ranked by impact-per-hour-of-code:

1. **Wider model + longer training** (~30 min, ~1 hr) — D=128, 6
   blocks, 4 heads, 30K steps. Should land near 1.7 bits/char and
   produce noticeably more coherent text.
2. **Longer context window** (~1 hr code if T=128 fits memory) —
   doubles the receptive field. Should help past the current
   ~50-char semantic-coherence cliff.
3. **Real gather primitive + BPE tokenizer** (1-2 days) — drops the
   one-hot quadratic cost and unlocks TinyStories / larger corpora.
4. **Cosine-decay LR + warmup** (~30 min) — already wired in
   `TrainConfig`; the trainer just needs to thread it through.
5. **Validation perplexity reporting** (~30 min) — runs forward on
   val.bin every N steps, reports nats/char.

## The rule

A GPT-style autoregressive transformer is **the same transformer
we already have for ViT, with three modifications**:

1. **Token embeddings** (look up learnable vectors by integer index)
2. **Causal attention mask** (each position attends only to itself + earlier positions)
3. **Next-token cross-entropy loss** (predict token `t+1` given tokens `1..t`)

All three pieces decompose to existing primitives or trivial new
ops. **No new VJP machinery** if we route token embeddings through
a one-hot workaround (or pay for a small new gather primitive).

This is the cheapest possible "expand to a new modality" demo:
shares almost everything with ViT, but the demo output (generated
text) reads as a clearly different category.

## Architecture: char-level tiny GPT

| Piece | Source | New work |
|---|---|---|
| Tokenizer | char-level (~65 unique chars on Shakespeare) | trivial dict |
| Token embedding | learnable `(vocab_size, d_model)` matrix, looked up by integer | new primitive (gather) or one-hot workaround |
| Positional embedding | learnable `(max_seq_len, d_model)` or sinusoidal | dense add, existing |
| Transformer blocks | existing `transformerEncoder` from ViT | none |
| Causal mask | triangular -∞ mask added to QK^T before softmax | small data-side addition |
| Output head | dense from `d_model` to `vocab_size` | existing |

Tiny demo sizing: 6 layers × 128 dim × 2 heads = ~2M params. Or
nano-GPT scale: 4 layers × 64 dim = ~500K params. Both work on
Shakespeare; smaller trains faster.

## New primitives

### Token embedding (gather)

Look up rows of a learnable `(vocab_size, d_model)` matrix by
integer indices. Two implementation paths:

| Approach | Forward | Backward |
|---|---|---|
| **Gather primitive (new)** | `out[i] = E[ids[i]]` | scatter-add gradient back to `E[ids[i]]` |
| **One-hot workaround** | `out = OneHot(ids) @ E` | matmul backward (existing) |

The one-hot version reuses existing matmul infrastructure but is
inefficient at large vocab. For char-level (vocab=65) it's totally
fine. For BPE (vocab~50K) it'd be wasteful — but defer that until
needed.

**Recommendation: one-hot workaround for the demo, ~1 day.** Add
a real gather primitive later if BPE-tokenized models become a goal.

### Causal attention mask

Add a constant mask to attention scores before softmax:

```
mask[i, j] = 0  if j <= i   (allowed)
            -∞ if j >  i   (blocked, becomes 0 after softmax)
```

Pure data-side: precompute once at start, reuse every step. The
softmax handles the rest. **~2-3 days** to wire into the existing
`transformerEncoder` (probably as a TrainConfig knob: `causal: Bool`).

### Loss + training

Standard cross-entropy on next-token prediction. Already proved.
~1 day to wire up — the only twist is "shift labels by one"
relative to the inputs.

## Data pipeline

Shakespeare's complete works as char stream:

| | Shakespeare (char-level) | TinyStories (BPE) |
|---|---|---|
| Disk | ~1.1MB raw text | ~30MB |
| Vocab | ~65 chars | ~16K BPE tokens |
| Sequences | random chunks of length 64-256 | same |
| Demo output | "Shakespearean prose" | "GPT-2-style stories" |

| Item | Effort |
|---|---|
| Char-level tokenizer (dict + encode/decode) | 1 day |
| Dataset loader (`shakespeare` variant of `DatasetIO`) | 2-3 days |
| Random-chunk sampler (one batch = N chunks of length T) | 1-2 days |

**~1 week total.** Tiny dataset, no augmentation, no preprocessing
beyond character → integer mapping.

For a more capable demo: TinyStories (~30MB, simple 3-year-old-level
stories generated by GPT-3.5) gives much more coherent generation.
But needs a BPE tokenizer (~3-5 days more to add). Defer.

## Training

| Item | Effort |
|---|---|
| Modified train step (causal mask + next-token loss + shift-by-1) | 1 week |
| Eval (perplexity on held-out chunk) | 2-3 days |

Batch size 32-64 chunks of length 128-256, AdamW + cosine schedule
+ warmup. Standard.

## Sampling (the demo's killer feature)

Autoregressive generation given a prompt:

```
def sample(prompt, max_new_tokens, temperature=1.0):
    ids = tokenize(prompt)
    for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
        logits = model(ids)
        next_id = sample_from(logits[-1] / temperature)
        ids.append(next_id)
    return detokenize(ids)
```

Pure inference exe, separate from training. Add basic sampling
controls (temperature, top-k, top-p) — each is a 1-line
modification to the logit selection.

| Item | Effort |
|---|---|
| Sampling exe (greedy + temperature + top-k + top-p) | 1 week |
| Demo: prompt with "ROMEO:", generate 500 chars, save to text file | 1 day |

## Sequencing

**No prerequisite — fully standalone.**

**Phase 1 — primitives (1 week):**
- Token embedding (one-hot workaround or gather primitive)
- Causal attention mask (TrainConfig knob + helper)
- Char-level tokenizer

**Phase 2 — training (1-2 weeks):**
- Shakespeare dataset loader
- NetSpec for nano-GPT (~500K-2M params)
- Modified train step (causal + next-token)
- Perplexity eval

**Phase 3 — sampling + demo (1 week):**
- Autoregressive sampling exe
- Generated-text output (Shakespeare-style or original-prompt continuation)
- Bestiary entry write-up with sample output included

**Total: ~3-4 weeks.** Cheapest of the planned demos by a wide margin.

## Cells to add

```
("nano-gpt-shakespeare",  ⟨nanoGptSpec, gptShakespeareConfig, .shakespeare, "data/shakespeare"⟩),
("tiny-gpt-shakespeare",  ⟨tinyGptSpec, gptShakespeareConfig, .shakespeare, "data/shakespeare"⟩),
```

Two cells: nano (~500K params, faster) and tiny (~2M params,
better samples). Lets readers see the "more params → better text"
relationship at modest scale.

## Compute budget

- Shakespeare: ~1M tokens, batch=32 × seq=256 = 8K tokens/batch
- ~125 batches/epoch (1M / 8K), 50 epochs = 6250 iterations
- Tiny GPT (~2M params) at ~50ms/iter = ~5 minutes total
- Nano GPT (~500K params) at ~30ms/iter = ~3 minutes total

Yes, **minutes, not hours**. The smallest demo by far. Trains so
fast you can iterate on hyperparameters in real-time.

Sampling 500 chars: <1 second.

## What this unlocks

Closing the language gap unlocks a *lot*:

- **All NLP demos** — sentiment classification, machine translation, etc.
- **CLIP / multimodal models** — needs a text encoder (this demo IS a text encoder)
- **Instruction-tuned models** — same architecture, fine-tuned on instruction-response pairs
- **RLHF-style training** — combine with a reward model (further down the road)
- **Code generation** — same architecture, code-corpus training
- **Anything autoregressive** — music generation, time-series, agent action sequences

The token-embedding + causal-mask combo is the gateway to the
entire modern LLM family. Even though the demo itself is tiny,
the **architecture pattern** scales directly to GPT-3/4 size if
you have the compute.

## Honest tradeoff

Char-level Shakespeare with ~2M params:
- **Sample quality**: recognizably Shakespearean — correct vocabulary,
  blank-verse-ish meter, plausible character names — but the
  semantic coherence drops after ~50 chars
- **Perplexity**: probably ~3-4 bits/char vs paper-quality ~1-2
  bits/char (which need bigger models + BPE tokenization)
- **Demo value**: "the framework generates text from scratch" with
  visible Shakespearean output is the story. Quality gaps don't
  invalidate the demo.

## Why this is cheap

Almost everything reuses ViT infrastructure:

| ViT primitive | Used by GPT? |
|---|---|
| `transformerEncoder` | yes (with causal mask) |
| Self-attention (Q/K/V matmul + softmax) | yes |
| MLP sublayer | yes |
| LayerNorm | yes |
| Positional encoding | yes (or learnable variant) |
| Patch embedding | no — replaced by token embedding |
| Class token | no — autoregressive doesn't use one |

Net delta: **swap patch embedding → token embedding, add a causal
mask, change the loss head**. That's it. Everything else is
already proved.

## Out of scope (deferred)

- **BPE tokenizer** — vocab~50K instead of ~65; needs gather
  primitive done properly. Defer until char-level demo is solid.
- **TinyStories or larger corpus** — needs BPE; skip for v1.
- **Instruction tuning** — needs separate paired-data pipeline;
  follow-on demo.
- **RLHF** — needs reward model + PPO/DPO; major project.
- **Mixture of experts** — adds routing primitive; separate work.
- **KV cache for fast inference** — optimization for production
  inference; sampling is already fast at this scale.
- **Flash Attention / memory-optimized attention** — optimization,
  not architectural; demo is small enough not to need it.
