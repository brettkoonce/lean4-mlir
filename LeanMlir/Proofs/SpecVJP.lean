/-! # Spec → math (the verification tie), Rung 1: the linear classifier

The shape `#guard` in `MainResnet34Verified` only checks the *parameter interface*
(typechecking). This file is the first rung of connecting a readable `VerifiedNetSpec`
to the actual **math** — the proven VJP — on the simplest net, the Chapter-2 linear
classifier (`dense 784→10`).

The pattern (extends to MLP → conv nets, each rigid/per-net):
  1. `denote` maps the spec's layers to the Mathlib math function the proofs are about;
  2. a `rfl` lemma ties the spec's denotation to that named function (`mnistLinear`);
  3. the whole-model VJP theorem is stated about *the spec's denotation* and discharged
     by the audited op-level VJP (`dense_has_vjp`).

If the spec's `layers` drifts from `[.dense 784 10]`, step 2/3 stop reducing and the
proofs fail to typecheck — so the readable architecture is provably the verified one,
at the math level, not just the shape level.

open Proofs

/- `linearVerified` (the single dense 784→10 spec) is imported from `LeanMlir.VerifiedNets`
   — the *same* object `MainMnistLinearVerified` trains, so the VJP below is about the
   trainer's exact spec, not a copy. The shape tie (`toSpecs == …`) lives there too. -/

/-- Math denotation of the linear spec. The Chapter-2 model is a single dense layer, so
    `[.dense 784 10]` denotes to the Mathlib `dense W b`. Any other layer list is not the
    linear model (`0`), which makes the tie below drift-sensitive. -/

  | _               => fun _ => 0

/-- **Spec ≡ the proven model.** `linearVerified`'s denotation is exactly `mnistLinear`
    (the function the Chapter-2 VJP capstone is about) — by `rfl`, so it's checked by the
    kernel and breaks if `linearVerified.layers` changes. -/

/-- **The spec carries the math.** The linear spec's denotation has the proven VJP —
    discharged by the audited `dense_has_vjp`. This is the whole-model verification
    stated about the *readable layer list*, not a hand-written function. -/
