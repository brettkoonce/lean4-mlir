/-! # PoC: the bf16-mixed MNIST-linear render-tie (planning §5, the symmetric gap)

The companion to `E4M3FaithfulPoC.lean`. Where the fp8 render-tie is **proven but
un-lowered** (IREE's CUDA backend can't emit f8 — see
`upstream-issues/2026-06-iree-cuda-fp8-nvptx-lowering/`), bf16 is the inverse: its
mixed-precision *accuracy* bound exists (`FloatBridge.dense_close_mixed`,
`u_leaf = 2⁻⁸`) and it **does lower on CUDA** (a `bf16`-in / `f32`-accumulate
`dot_general` compiles for `sm_86`/`sm_89`), but its proof was **untied** — nothing
connected the emitted bf16 graph to that bound. This file closes the structural
half: the bf16-mixed linear graph **denotes** the rounded-operand linear, for any
rounding `rnd` (bf16 being one instance). No accuracy claim — purely "the bf16 cast
+ matmul + fp32 accumulate computes `dense` of the rounded operands".

**Why this is the simpler twin of §3b.** The deployed bf16-mixed kernel is "cast
operands to bf16, multiply-accumulate in fp32". The fp32 accumulate makes the
reduction the *exact* `∑` (in ℝ), so — exactly as the fp8 §3b tie treats the
int-accumulate — the only deviation from exact is in the *operands*. There is no
block scale to factor through the sum (fp8's `dequant_factors`), so the tie falls
straight out of the `den`-faithful `operand`/`dotIn`/`addBcast` ops.

**No `SHlo` surgery (at depth 1).** The bf16 cast on the *input* activations is
baked into the operand value `rnd ∘ x` — the byte preparation the kernel does
before the GEMM — so depth-1 needs no new op, mirroring `E4M3FaithfulPoC`'s
host-side `actCode`. Depth > 1 (rounding *intermediate* activations) needs an
in-graph `convertF` round node (`den (convertF rnd e) = rnd ∘ den e`); that op is
the same ingredient fp8's depth-> 1 in-graph quant (planning §5) would use.

**Accuracy companion (separate, already exists).** Instantiate this tie's abstract
`rnd` at bf16 round-to-nearest and feed `|rnd x − x| ≤ 2⁻⁸|x|` into
`FloatBridge.dense_close_mixed` (`u_leaf = 2⁻⁸`, `u_acc = 2⁻²⁴` for the fp32
accumulate). Render-tie (here) ∘ accuracy (there) = the tied-and-lowered bf16
forward — the thing fp8 can prove but not run, and bf16 can now do both.

All theorems kernel-close under `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
(`tests/AuditAxioms.lean`); names kept short for the audit's per-line grep.

    ops: `operand` (the bf16 activation bytes) → `dotIn` (bf16 weights; the `den`
    `∑` is the fp32 accumulate) → `addBcast` (the fp32 bias). The "bf16 leaf, fp32

/-- **The intended algorithm:** the exact-ℝ linear map on the rounded operands,

    bf16 cast + fp32-accumulate matmul implements `dense` of the rounded operands".
    Strictly simpler than `e4m3_render_faithful`: no scale to factor, so it is the
