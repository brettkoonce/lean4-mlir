/-! # AlphaGo — Bestiary entry

AlphaGo (Silver et al., Nature 2016 --- "Mastering the game of Go
with deep neural networks and tree search") is the system that beat
Lee Sedol 4--1 in March 2016 --- the first time a computer defeated
a top-ranked human Go professional. It also made ``neural network +
Monte Carlo Tree Search'' the reference template for board-game AI
for half a decade.

We already have \texttt{AlphaZero.lean} in the bestiary covering
AlphaGo Zero + AlphaZero (the 2017--2018 successors). Those
architectures are both one two-headed network: a shared convolutional
body feeding parallel policy + value heads. AlphaGo the original
was \emph{three separate networks}:

1. **Policy network** ($p_\sigma$, then $p_\rho$). A 13-layer conv
   net trained first on $\sim$30M human-expert Go positions
   (supervised $p_\sigma$) then further refined via self-play RL
   ($p_\rho$). Predicts probability of each move given the board.
   $\sim$4.5M params.
2. **Value network** ($v_\theta$). A 13-layer conv net followed by
   fully-connected heads, predicting win probability from the
   current position. $\sim$5M params.
3. **Rollout policy** ($p_\pi$). A \emph{shallow} linear softmax
   over $\sim$$10^5$ hand-crafted binary features (3$\times$3
   stone patterns, liberties, responses to previous move, etc.).
   Used inside MCTS for fast tree playouts --- the full 13-layer
   net would be too slow for the thousands of simulations per move.

Plus hand-crafted \textbf{48 input feature planes} instead of raw
board state. Many of those planes are parity-specific indicator
features (``stone captured last move,'' ``ladder works,'' liberty
counts). Two years later, AlphaGo Zero threw all of this out ---
just the raw 19$\times$19 board history + one two-headed network
trained purely from self-play --- and \emph{played better}. That
simplification is the lesson.

## Architecture differences vs AlphaGo Zero

| Aspect               | AlphaGo (2016)        | AlphaGo Zero (2017)      |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Input features       | 48 hand-crafted planes | 17 raw-history planes   |
| Networks             | 3 separate            | 1 two-headed            |
| Training data        | Human games + RL      | Self-play only          |
| Rollout inside MCTS  | Fast shallow net      | Value head directly     |
| Parameter count      | $\sim$10M total       | $\sim$25M (bigger body) |
| Elo (full system)    | 3140                  | 5185                    |

The lesson ran counter to the field's working assumption in 2016 ---
``of course you need hand-crafted features and multiple networks for
a game this complex.'' AlphaGo Zero showed that neither was
necessary. The raw-board, shared-body template then generalized
trivially to chess and shogi as AlphaZero.

## Variants

- `alphaGoPolicyNet` --- 13-layer conv policy net (19$\times$19$\times$48
  input, 362 output moves)
- `alphaGoValueNet`  --- 13-layer conv value net with FC head (scalar
  win-probability output)
- `alphaGoRollout`   --- the shallow linear softmax used inside MCTS
- `tinyAlphaGo`      --- compact fixture
