/-! # QANet — Bestiary entry

QANet (Yu, Dohan, Luong, Zhao, Chen, Norouzi, Le, ICLR 2018 ---
"QANet: Combining Local Convolution with Global Self-Attention for
Reading Comprehension") is the reading-comprehension architecture
that first showed you could kill the LSTM from SQuAD-style question-
answering pipelines and \emph{speed training up 3--4$\times$} without
losing accuracy.

The context matters. Pre-2018, BiDAF (BiDirectional Attention Flow)
and its BiLSTM cousins dominated SQuAD. They scored well, but BiLSTMs
don't parallelize across timesteps --- each token has to wait for
its predecessor. On SQuAD-sized contexts (400+ tokens) this meant
hours-per-epoch training runs on already-expensive GPU hardware.
QANet's pitch was \textbf{same accuracy, much faster}, achieved by
throwing out recurrence entirely.

## The QANet encoder block

The core architectural unit --- what makes QANet QANet --- is a
hybrid ``conv + attention'' block:

```
  Input token representations (n × 128)
        │
        ▼  (repeated 4 times)
   LayerNorm → depthwise separable conv (kernel 7, 128→128)
        │      (+ residual)
        ▼
   LayerNorm → multi-head self-attention (8 heads, 128-dim)
        │      (+ residual)
        ▼
   LayerNorm → FFN (128 → 512 → 128)
        │      (+ residual)
        ▼
  Output (n × 128)
```

The separable convs give \emph{local} context (sliding window of 7
tokens); the self-attention gives \emph{global} context (every
token to every other). Both in the same block, both residual-
connected. This ``local conv + global attention'' hybrid pre-dates
MobileViT (2022), ConvNeXt's 7$\times$7 depthwise (2022), and the
general 2020--2022 trend of reintroducing convolutions into vision
transformers. QANet had it in 2018 because convolutions were fast
and parallelizable, which was the whole point.

## Overall QANet structure

```
  Question                 Context
     │                        │
     ▼ char + word emb         ▼ char + word emb
  Embedding encoder        Embedding encoder
  (1 × encoder block)      (1 × encoder block)
     │                        │
     └──────┬──────────────────┘
            ▼
  Context-query attention (BiDAF-style bidirectional attention)
            │
            ▼
  Model encoder × 3 stacks (each 7 × encoder block)
            │
            ▼
  Output: two pointer networks predicting (start, end) in context
```

The embedding encoder appears at the input (question and context
sides share weights). The model encoder is 7 blocks stacked,
repeated 3 times, for the main body. Output is two small softmax
heads that predict span start and end token positions.

## Why QANet matters pedagogically

Two reasons. First, the ``conv + attention hybrid'' shape was
novel in 2018 and has since become the default for efficient
architectures that want the inductive biases of both. Second, it's
a clean case of \textbf{hardware forcing a design choice}: the
primary argument for QANet vs BiDAF wasn't accuracy (comparable),
it was training speed. The paper explicitly frames the contribution
as ``3--4x speedup on the same hardware,'' and the architectural
decisions (no recurrence, heavy use of parallelizable convs, self-
attention instead of LSTM gating) all trace back to that constraint.

## Variants

- `qanetEncoderBlock`       --- the hybrid architectural unit
                                (one "conv + attention" block)
- `qanetModelEncoderStack`  --- 7 encoder blocks stacked
                                (repeated 3$\times$ in the full model)
- `tinyQANet`               --- fixture

## NetSpec simplifications

- Character/word embedding tables are omitted (shape-only; real QANet
  uses GloVe for words + a character-CNN for subword features, maybe
  100M combined at typical SQuAD vocab sizes).
- BiDAF-style context-query attention doesn't fit a linear NetSpec
  cleanly (it's bidirectional between two sequences); described in
  prose only.
- Output pointer networks (two softmax heads over context positions)
  also omitted --- they're task-specific heads at low parameter cost.
