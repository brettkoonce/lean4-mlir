# Run leanprover/comparator against the 52 theorems in Solution.lean.
#
# What it verifies (per Lean's kernel, independently of the elaborator):
#   1. Solution's theorem statements bit-identically match Challenge's
#      (so the prover didn't redefine the goal).
#   2. Each proof's transitive axiom closure is a subset of
#      [propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice] — i.e. zero project axioms.
#   3. The proof typechecks against Lean's kernel.
#
# Prerequisites (one-time setup):
#   - Linux kernel ≥ 6.10 (for Landlock ABI v5 — `uname -r`)
#   - landrun: https://github.com/Zouuup/landrun (prebuilt binary)
#   - lean4export: https://github.com/leanprover/lean4export (lake build)
#   - comparator: https://github.com/leanprover/comparator (lake build)
#
# All three binaries must be on PATH. See README.md for a setup recipe.
#
# Usage: ./run.sh
